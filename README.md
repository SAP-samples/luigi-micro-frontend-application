# Luigi Micro Frontend Application Tutorial

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/luigi-micro-frontend-application)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/luigi-micro-frontend-application)

## Description

This repository contains the source code of a tutorial on how to create a micro frontend application with [Luigi](https://luigi-project.io). The tutorial shows how to create a simple online shopping application. The main application uses React, while the micro frontend is developed with SAP UI5. Luigi brings the two together and allows you to create a consistent user interface, while also configuring additional features. One such feature is localization for displaying the site in German or English.

## Download and installation

The tutorial includes step-by-step instructions on how to create this application from scratch and can be found on [developers.sap.com](https://developers.sap.com).

    ```
In a new terminal window, open the `ui5-mf` folder which contains the micro frontend for the core app you ran previously. Use these commands to run `ui5-mf`:
